# RELEASE HISTORY

## 0.2.0 / 2012-12-21

This release modifies Bang! Bang! to rely on BRASS #assert and #refute
methods directly. This simplifies the code a bit and takes care of
tracking assertion counts automatically.

Changes:

* Use Brass #assert and #refute methods.
* Access project metadata dynamically via const_missing.


## 0.1.0 / 2012-02-09

This is the initial release of Bang.

Changes:

* Happy Birthday!
